#  Predictive Analysis of Customer Churn for SyriaTel Telecom
## Overview
SyriaTel is a telecommunications company that, like many others in the industry, faces the challenge of customer churn (when customers discontinue their service or switch to competitors). Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn reduction a key business priority.

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and build a predictive machine learning model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, the company can design targeted retention strategies, optimize customer service efforts, and ultimately improve profitability.
