    "## 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "SyriaTel is a telecommunications company that, like many others in the industry, faces the challenge of customer churn—when customers discontinue their service or switch to competitors. Retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn reduction a key business priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze customer behavior and build a predictive machine learning model that can identify customers at risk of churning. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, the company can design targeted retention strategies, optimize customer service efforts, and ultimately improve profitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to develop a robust and interpretable classification model that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn.\n",
    "- Provide insights into the key drivers of churn.\n",
    "- Support data-driven decision-making for retention initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is a significant threat to recurring revenue. SyriaTel seeks a solution that not only predicts churn but also offers actionable insights to reduce it. This project focuses on exploring historical customer data to uncover patterns and build a model that distinguishes between loyal and churning customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the distribution and structure of customer-related features.\n",
    "- Explore relationships between customer attributes and churn behavior.\n",
    "- Engineer relevant features that improve model performance.\n",
    "- Train and evaluate multiple classification models using industry-standard metrics.\n",
    "- Interpret model results to inform business actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Technical Accuracy**: High performance in metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, with special emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: Clear identification of the most influential features contributing to customer churn.\n",
    "- **Business Impact**: Practical recommendations based on model results to inform marketing, customer service, and product strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is historical and may contain imbalances (e.g., more loyal than churning customers).\n",
    "- The model will focus on binary classification (Churn vs. No Churn).\n",
    "- The data is assumed to be representative of current customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will form the foundation for SyriaTel’s churn management strategy by helping the business proactively retain customers and allocate resources effectively.\n"
